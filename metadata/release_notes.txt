Smart scanning!

In addition to scanning barcodes, the scanner also tries to extract the voucher's description, expiry date and balance.
At this stage it only supports the English language.

You can toggle this setting in the menu.

Other changes:
- Immediately open scanner when adding a new voucher
- Fixed some bugs
